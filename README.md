# PD-fLGMRES
# Adaptive Improvements to the LGMRES(m, l) Method for Efficient Resolution of Sparse Linear Systems in Computational Fluid Dynamics
 

## Requirements

To reproduce the results, you will need the Mimetic Operator Library Enhanced[(MOLE)](https://github.com/csrc-sdsu/mole) (as forked [here](https://github.com/gusespinola/mole)) and the Krylov Subspace-Based Adaptive Solvers [(KrySBAS)](https://github.com/nidtec-una/krysbas-dev/) library (release [0.3.1](https://github.com/nidtec-una/krysbas-dev/releases/tag/v0.3.1)).

## Reproducing the results

To reproduce the results, you should run the file minimal_poisson2D.m.

If you wish to generate plots for convergence and evolution of the restart parameter m, and/or skip some computations, you can activate the corresponding control flags embedded in the source code.

## Citing

If you use (either all or a part of) the code present in this repository, I ask you to cite [1].
